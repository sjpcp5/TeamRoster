## User Story 
As a software team manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's dossiers 
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub Profiles.


## Business Context
Time is money and so is well organized information. 
Managers need pertenant information to make informed decisions 
to manage their project and team effectively. 
Having readily available dossiers all the selected team members view
helps keep the mind organized and ready to make a quick informed decision.
